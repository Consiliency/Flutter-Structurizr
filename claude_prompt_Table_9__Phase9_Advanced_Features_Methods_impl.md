# Table 9: Phase 9 Advanced Features â€“ Method Implementation Details

| Method/Area                 | Implementation Details / Notes |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Command.execute/undo/redo   | Each user action (move, add, delete, update) is a Command subclass. Undo/redo managed by HistoryManager. |
| Command.tryMergeWith        | Used for merging similar commands (e.g., continuous drag). |
| HistoryManager              | Maintains undo/redo stacks, supports transactions, integrates with WorkspaceManager. |
| Versioning                  | Snapshots stored as serialized workspace states. Comparison via diffing, restore by replacing current state. |
| LODManager                  | Observes zoom level, triggers re-render with appropriate detail. |
| Culling/Progressive Render  | Uses viewport bounds to skip/cull elements, progressive rendering for large models. |
| Parallel Processing         | Uses isolates or worker_manager for async/batch ops. Progress/cancellation via callbacks. |
| Documentation Search        | Index built on documentation/ADR content. Search returns ranked, filtered, and highlighted results. |
| Math Equation Support       | Integrates flutter_math_fork for rendering, equation editor for input, numbering via parser. |
| Mobile/Desktop Enhancements | Platform checks for gesture/keyboard handling, responsive layout, context menus, drag-and-drop. |
| Advanced Testing            | Uses golden_toolkit for visual tests, performance benchmarks, stress and accessibility tests. |
