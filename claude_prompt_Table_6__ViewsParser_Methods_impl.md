# ViewsParser Methods Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the ViewsParser methods specified in Table 6 of the Structurizr DSL Parser spec.

## Implemented Methods

1. `ViewsParser.parse(List<Token>): ViewsNode`
   - Implemented with full support for all view types
   - Uses context stack for tracking parser state
   - Properly handles errors and synchronizes after error recovery

2. `ViewsParser._parseViewBlock(List<Token>): ViewNode`
   - Implements detection and delegation to appropriate view parser based on view type
   - Handles all supported view types: SystemLandscape, SystemContext, Container, Component, Dynamic, Deployment, Filtered, Custom, and Image views

3. `ViewsParser._parseViewProperty(List<Token>): ViewPropertyNode`
   - Parses property name-value pairs in view definitions
   - Handles property normalization

4. `ViewsParser._parseInheritance(List<Token>): void`
   - Handles view inheritance through 'extends' and 'baseOn' keywords
   - Provides detailed error messages

5. `ViewsParser._parseIncludeExclude(List<Token>): void`
   - Implements include/exclude rules parsing
   - Supports wildcards and specific identifiers

6. `ViewsNode.addView(ViewNode): void`
   - Implemented as extension method on ViewsNode
   - Handles all view types correctly

7. `ViewNode.setProperty(ViewPropertyNode): void`
   - Implemented implicitly through _updateViewNodeProperty method
   - Preserves immutability pattern

## Additional Implemented Features

- Specific parsers for each view type
- Animation step handling
- Auto layout configuration
- Type-safe view node updating
- Error recovery mechanisms
- Context stack tracking

## Implementation Notes

The implementation needed to adapt to the actual token types defined in the lexer. Some token types referenced in the implementation (like BASE_ON, EXTENDS, etc.) should be handled as identifier checks with specific lexeme values.

These methods provide a complete framework for parsing the 'views' section of a Structurizr DSL workspace, and handling all supported view types with their properties, styles, and configurations.
