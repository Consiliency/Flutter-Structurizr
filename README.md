# Flutter Structurizr

> **Note:** While all core features are complete and production-ready, the parsing and model-building pipeline is currently being refactored into modular, interface-driven components for maintainability, Java parity, and parallel development. See the audit and handoff tables in `specs/` for details. This does not affect end-user features but is critical for long-term code health.

A cross-platform, production-ready implementation of the Structurizr architecture visualization tool in Flutter. This project provides a complete, feature-rich application for visualizing software architecture using the C4 model, with full support for modeling, rendering, documentation, export, and workspace management.

## Project Status

✅ **ALL CORE PHASES (1-8) COMPLETE**

The application is fully usable and production-ready. Phase 9 (advanced features) is in progress, with the undo/redo system fully implemented including command merging and transaction support. See [Implementation Status](specs/implementation_status.md) for details.

> **Recent Update (2024-06):**
> - Major batch fixes have stabilized the parser, model, and widget tests. Most ambiguous import/type errors and widget layout issues in tests are now resolved.
> - The modular parser refactor is well underway. All parser/model/view files now use explicit imports and type aliases to avoid conflicts with Flutter built-ins. See the audit and handoff tables in `specs/` for details.
> - Contributors: Always run tests with `flutter test` (not `dart test`) to ensure correct environment and widget support.
> - For contributors: See the new troubleshooting section below for common issues and solutions.

## Architecture

> **Parser Refactor:** The DSL parser and builder are being modularized into interface-driven components (e.g., ModelParser, ViewsParser, RelationshipParser, etc.) to improve maintainability, enable parallel development, and match the Java Structurizr DSL. See `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` and `specs/refactored_method_relationship.md` for up-to-date interfaces and build order.

The application follows a clean architecture approach with:

- **Domain Layer**: Pure Dart models with no dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and workflows
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External service implementations
- **Presentation Layer**: Flutter UI components

The project structure follows this architecture:

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.19.0 or higher (Dart SDK 3.4.0+)
- Git
- For Linux: clang, cmake, ninja-build, gtk3-devel
- For macOS: Xcode command line tools

### Quick Setup

We provide two setup scripts for different environments:

#### For Regular Development (with internet):
```bash
./setup_dev_env.sh
```

This script will:
- Check and install the correct Flutter version (3.19.0+)
- Install required system packages
- Set up development environment
- Run initial builds and tests

**Note:** This script requires internet access to download dependencies.

#### For Codex Offline Development:
```bash
./codex_offline_setup_split.sh
```

This script is specifically for Codex environments without internet access. It:
- Reassembles split archive files (GitHub-friendly 95MB chunks)
- Extracts the complete Flutter SDK (704MB total)
- Extracts all pre-cached packages (387MB total)
- Configures offline Flutter/Dart environment
- Provides full Flutter capabilities for desktop development
- All necessary files are included in the repository

### Manual Environment Setup
1. Copy the environment example file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit `.env` and add your actual API keys (if using any AI services)

3. For MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .mcp.example.json .mcp.json
   ```
   Then update with your specific MCP settings.

### Building from Source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-structurizr.git
   cd flutter-structurizr
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Generate necessary code:
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```
4. Run the demo app:
   ```bash
   cd demo_app
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d [device]
   ```
   Replace `[device]` with your target device/platform (chrome, windows, linux, macos, etc.)

### Running Examples
See the `example/` directory for focused example apps (animation, documentation, export, etc.).

### Building for Production
```bash
# For Windows
flutter build windows
# For macOS
flutter build macos
# For Linux
flutter build linux
# For Web
flutter build web
# For Android
flutter build apk
# For iOS
flutter build ios
```

## Usage

### Opening and Creating Workspaces
- Launch the application and use the Workspace Manager to create or open workspaces (DSL or JSON).
- Add elements, relationships, and views using the UI.
- Edit documentation and ADRs in Markdown or AsciiDoc.
- Use the View Selector and Element Explorer for navigation.

### Exporting
- Use the Export button to export diagrams in PNG, SVG, PlantUML, Mermaid, DOT, DSL, or JSON/YAML formats.
- Configure export options and preview results in real time.
- Use batch export for multiple diagrams.

### Advanced Features
- Use the Documentation tab for rich documentation and embedded diagrams.
- Manage ADRs with the Decision Graph, Timeline, and List views.
- Undo/redo and advanced state management are available (Phase 9, in progress).

## Troubleshooting (2024-06)

### Common Test and Layout Issues

- **RenderBox was not laid out**: This usually means a widget (often a Column or Row) contains an Expanded/Flexible child without bounded constraints. Solution: Remove the top-level Expanded/Flexible or wrap the widget in a SizedBox with explicit width/height in your test.
- **Ambiguous import/type errors**: Use explicit import prefixes or `show`/`hide` directives for types like Element, Container, View, Border, etc. Always import from the canonical model file.
- **Test mocks/type mismatches**: Ensure all test mocks match the interface exactly (e.g., Model addElement returns Model, not void). Update mocks after interface changes.
- **Tests fail only with flutter test**: Always use `flutter test` for widget and integration tests. `dart test` does not provide the correct environment for Flutter widgets.

### Modular Parser Refactor

- The parser and model-building pipeline is being modularized for maintainability and Java parity. This is an internal refactor and does not affect end-user features, but contributors should follow the new interface-driven approach and consult the audit/handoff tables in `specs/`.
- All new code should use explicit imports and type aliases to avoid conflicts with Flutter built-ins.
