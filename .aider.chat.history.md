#### Based on the research in the message, enhance the app_context detection module to better distinguish between different text input types within the same application. Focus on:  
####   
#### 1. Improving detection for VS Code/Cursor to clearly differentiate between:  
####    - Code editor  
####    - Terminal  
####    - AI Chat/Conversation panels  
####      
#### 2. Add more robust detection for browser text fields:  
####    - Address bar vs. webpage form fields  
####    - Document editors within browsers (Google Docs, etc.)  
####      
#### 3. Strengthen the logic for determining if a field is multi-line vs. single-line  
####   
#### The main focus should be enhancing the detection logic in app_context.py with particular attention to the chat interface detection since that's what the user is having trouble with.  
####   
#### Add more detailed logging to show exactly which detection rule matched and why a particular interface was identified as a terminal or chat.
