# Claude Code Agent: Table 1: Token/ContextStack/Node Foundation - IMPLEMENTATION

You are an expert Dart/Flutter and Structurizr DSL developer. Your task is to generate complete, idiomatic Dart implementation code for ALL methods detailed in `specs/table_1_token_contextstack_node_foundation.md` for the dart-structurizr project. You should also consult `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` for broader architectural context and implementation strategies. Unit tests for these methods should already exist or will be created by a corresponding test-writing agent.

**Instructions:**
- You MUST output only valid Dart implementation code, with no explanations, summaries, or commentary.
- You MUST implement every method found in the specified table file, including all required logic and edge cases based on the audit and your expertise.
- Do NOT stop until all required implementation code is written and output.
- Output the code into the appropriate files under `lib/domain/parser/`. For Table 1, `ContextStack` would likely be in `lib/domain/parser/context_stack.dart`; `handleError` and `integrateSubmodules` would likely be part of a central `Parser` class (e.g., `lib/domain/parser/parser.dart`). Ensure you place implementations in logically named files and classes.
- Do NOT summarize, explain, or ask questionsâ€”just write the code.
