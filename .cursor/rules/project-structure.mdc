# Project Structure Guidelines

- Follow the clean architecture approach: domain, application, infrastructure, presentation layers.
- Keep all specs, implementation plans, and project status in the `specs/` directory.
- Do not duplicate status or user documentation in developer memory files (e.g., CLAUDE.md).
- Place all user-facing documentation in the README and specs.
- Use example/ for focused example apps and demo_app/ for the main demo application.
- Organize tests to mirror the lib/ structure for easy navigation and coverage.
- Clean up unused files and helpers after refactors.
