# Testing Best Practices

- Use mock implementations for abstract classes and platform interfaces (e.g., WebViewPlatform) in tests.
- For WebView tests, inject a mock platform and use a test controller wrapper if needed for delegate/callback wiring.
- Use `findsWidgets` instead of `findsOneWidget` for components that may have multiple instances.
- Use ancestor finders for specific widget hierarchy checks.
- For context menu and right-click, verify structure rather than simulating clicks.
- For golden tests, plan for future visual regression coverage.
- Clean up unused imports and test helpers after refactors.
