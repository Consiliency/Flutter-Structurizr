# UI/UX Guidelines

- Provide keyboard shortcuts for all navigation-heavy interfaces.
- Use debouncing for export preview and performance-intensive UI updates.
- Implement help dialogs for keyboard shortcuts and advanced features.
- Use chip-based filtering and color coding for status and type indicators.
- Use responsive layouts and flexible sizing (Expanded, SingleChildScrollView) for complex UIs.
- Prefer Material components for layout and interaction.
- Clean up unused UI components and helpers after refactors.
