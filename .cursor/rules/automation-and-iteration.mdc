# Automation and Iterative Development Rule

## 1. Inline Command Execution
- The IDE/AI should automatically run bash and PowerShell commands inline (in the terminal) whenever possible, especially for test runs, builds, and code checks.
- Prefer running commands directly in the shell rather than requiring manual user intervention, unless user confirmation is needed for safety or security.

## 2. Continuous Test-Fix Iteration
- Always continue iterating between running tests and applying code fixes until:
  - The user explicitly stops the process, **or**
  - An external factor (e.g., unrecoverable error, missing dependency, or explicit user instruction) prevents further automatic iteration.
- Do not pause for user confirmation between test-fix cycles unless required by context or user request.

## 3. Goal
- The goal is to maximize developer productivity and minimize manual steps by automating as much of the test-fix cycle as possible.
