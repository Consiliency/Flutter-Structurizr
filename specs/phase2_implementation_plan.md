# Phase 2: Rendering and Layout Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 covers the core rendering engine and layout algorithms for Flutter Structurizr. This phase focuses on implementing the visual representation of architecture diagrams, including element shape rendering, relationship drawing, and intelligent layout calculation.

## Current Status

**Status: COMPLETE** ✅

All rendering and layout components are now fully implemented, tested, and passing all tests.

## Completed Tasks

     - Person renderer
     - Component renderer

     - And other specialized shapes
   - Added support for colors, borders, shadows, and other styling options
   - Created tests for each renderer in `test/presentation/rendering/elements/`

3. ✅ **Relationship Renderer**
   - Implemented relationship rendering in `lib/presentation/rendering/relationships/relationship_renderer.dart`

   - Added arrow rendering for directional relationships
   - Implemented label positioning and rendering
   - Added support for multiple routing strategies (direct, curved, orthogonal)
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/rendering/relationships/relationship_renderer_test.dart`

4. ✅ **Boundary Renderer**
   - Implemented boundary rendering in `lib/presentation/rendering/boundaries/boundary_renderer.dart`
   - Added support for different boundary styles
   - Implemented proper containment visualization
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/rendering/boundaries/boundary_renderer_test.dart`

5. ✅ **Diagram Painter**
   - Implemented CustomPainter in `lib/presentation/rendering/diagram_painter.dart`
   - Integrated all renderer components
   - Added proper rendering order (boundaries, relationships, elements)
   - Implemented selection highlighting
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/rendering/diagram_painter_test.dart`

### Layout Algorithms

1. ✅ **Layout Strategy Interface**
   - Created abstract interface in `lib/presentation/layout/layout_strategy.dart`
   - Defined common methods for all layout algorithms
   - Fixed import path issues (using `hide View` directive)
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/layout/layout_strategy_test.dart`

2. ✅ **Force-Directed Layout**
   - Implemented physics-based layout in `lib/presentation/layout/force_directed_layout.dart`
   - Added spring forces for relationships
   - Added repulsive forces between elements
   - Implemented boundary containment forces
   - Added damping and equilibrium detection
   - Fixed import path issues from old structure
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/layout/force_directed_layout_test.dart`

3. ✅ **Grid Layout**
   - Implemented grid-based layout in `lib/presentation/layout/grid_layout.dart`
   - Added support for hierarchical grid layout
   - Implemented spacing and alignment options
   - Fixed import path issues
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/layout/grid_layout_test.dart`

4. ✅ **Manual Layout**
   - Implemented manual positioning support in `lib/presentation/layout/manual_layout.dart`
   - Added persistence of user-defined positions
   - Implemented fallback for unpositioned elements
   - Fixed import path issues
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/layout/manual_layout_test.dart`

5. ✅ **Automatic Layout**
   - Created meta-strategy in `lib/presentation/layout/automatic_layout.dart`
   - Implemented heuristics for selecting the best layout algorithm
   - Added layout selection based on diagram type and content
   - Fixed import path issues
   - Created tests in `test/presentation/layout/automatic_layout_test.dart`

6. ✅ **Layout Integration**
   - Created unified layout export in `lib/presentation/layout/layout.dart`
   - Fixed all imports to use current project structure
   - Fixed name conflicts by using `hide View` directive
   - Ensured proper integration with rendering engine

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

1. ✅ **Name Conflicts**
   - Resolved conflict between Flutter's `Element` and Structurizr's `Element` using `hide Element` directive
   - Resolved conflict between Flutter's `Container` and Structurizr's `Container` using `hide Container` directive
   - Added `View` to the list of hidden elements in Flutter material imports
   - Used consistent import pattern: `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Element, Container, View;`

2. ✅ **Package Path Corrections**
   - Fixed incorrect paths that were referencing old structure (`src/core/workspace.dart`)
   - Updated to use current structure (`domain/view/view.dart`, `domain/model/element.dart`)
   - Ensured consistent import patterns across all components

3. ✅ **Layout Algorithm Optimizations**
   - Implemented multi-phase layout for force-directed algorithm to avoid local minima
   - Added collision detection to prevent element overlap
   - Optimized performance for large diagrams

## Testing Strategy

The testing approach for Phase 2 included:

1. ✅ **Unit Tests for Renderers**
   - Testing each renderer individually with mock Canvas
   - Verifying correct drawing operations
   - Testing style application and visual effects

2. ✅ **Layout Algorithm Tests**
   - Testing each layout algorithm with various input scenarios
   - Verifying element positioning and relationship routing
   - Testing edge cases (empty diagrams, single elements, etc.)

3. ✅ **Integration Tests**
   - Testing the combined rendering and layout system
   - Verifying correct visual output with golden tests
   - Testing interactive elements (selection, hovering)

4. ✅ **Test Framework**
   - Created mock Canvas implementation for testing drawing operations
   - Added custom matchers for visual testing
   - Created helper methods for test workspace creation

## Verification

All tests for the rendering and layout components are now passing. The key verification areas included:

1. ✅ **Layout Algorithm Verification**
   - Force-directed layout properly positions related elements closer together
   - Grid layout creates structured arrangements
   - Manual layout preserves user positions
   - Automatic layout selects appropriate algorithm based on content

2. ✅ **Rendering Verification**
   - All element shapes render correctly with proper styles
   - Relationships are drawn with correct routing and arrow heads
   - Boundaries properly visualize containment
   - Selection and highlighting work correctly

3. ✅ **Integration Verification**
   - Layout and rendering components work together correctly
   - User interactions properly trigger rendering updates
   - Performance is acceptable for typical diagram sizes

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the project can move to:

1. ✅ Implement interactive UI components (Phase 3)
2. ❗ Integrate with DSL parser (Phase 4)
3. ❗ Add documentation rendering (Phase 5-6)
4. ☐ Implement export capabilities (Phase 8)
