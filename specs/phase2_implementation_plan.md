#### Test Implementation Guidelines

1. **Rendering Tests Structure**:
   ```dart
   testWidgets('Box renderer draws correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {
     // Setup mock canvas
     final mockCanvas = MockCanvas();
     
     // Create renderer
     final renderer = BoxRenderer();
     
     // Create test element
     final element = Person(id: 'test', name: 'Test Person');
     
     // Call render
     renderer.render(mockCanvas, element, Rect.fromLTWH(0, 0, 100, 80), null);
     
     // Verify expected drawing operations
     expect(mockCanvas.drawnShapes, contains(isA<RRect>()));
     expect(mockCanvas.drawnText, contains('Test Person'));
   });
   ```

2. **Layout Algorithm Testing**:
   ```dart
   test('Force-directed layout properly positions elements', () {
     // Setup test model
     final model = createTestModel();
     
     // Create layout
     final layout = ForceDirectedLayout();
     
     // Apply layout
     final positions = layout.layout(model);
     
     // Verify no overlaps
     for (var i = 0; i < positions.length; i++) {
       for (var j = i + 1; j < positions.length; j++) {
         expect(positions[i].overlaps(positions[j]), false);
       }
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Performance Testing**:
   ```dart
   test('Boundary renderer performance with large model', () {
     // Create large test model
     final model = createLargeTestModel(elementCount: 100);
     
     // Measure performance
     final stopwatch = Stopwatch()..start();
     renderer.render(canvas, model, viewport);
     stopwatch.stop();
     
     // Verify performance constraints
     expect(stopwatch.elapsedMilliseconds < 100, true);
   });
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Canvas Drawing Issues**:
   - Use the MockCanvas class to capture and verify drawing operations
   - Check clip bounds and transformations when elements aren't visible
   - Verify correct paint objects for styling (color, stroke width, etc.)

2. **Layout Algorithm Problems**:
   - Add debug visualization to see force vectors
   - Use smaller test models for isolated testing
   - Add stabilization detection to force-directed layouts

3. **Golden Test Failures**:
   - Different rendering on different platforms (use platform-specific goldens)
   - Font rendering differences (use consistent test fonts)
   - Anti-aliasing differences (use larger elements to minimize impact)
