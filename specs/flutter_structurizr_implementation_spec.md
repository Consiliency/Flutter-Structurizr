# Flutter Structurizr Implementation Specification

## Ongoing Parser Refactor and Modularization

> **Note:** While the DSL parser and builder are functionally complete and all core features are implemented, the team is currently undertaking a major refactor of the parsing and model-building pipeline. This refactor modularizes the parser into interface-driven components (e.g., ModelParser, ViewsParser, RelationshipParser, etc.) to:
> - Achieve full parity with the original Java Structurizr DSL implementation
> - Enable parallel development and clearer handoff between teams
> - Improve maintainability, extensibility, and testability
>
> Developers should reference the audit and method handoff tables in `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` and `specs/refactored_method_relationship.md` for up-to-date interfaces, dependencies, and build order. This work does not affect end-user features but is critical for the long-term health of the codebase.

## 1. Project Overview

The Flutter Structurizr project aims to create a complete, cross-platform implementation of the Structurizr architecture visualization tool in Flutter. This implementation will support all core features of the original Structurizr, including diagram rendering, DSL parsing, model manipulation, documentation viewing, and diagram export capabilities.

Unlike the current implementation which is scattered across multiple languages and technologies, this project will consolidate all functionality into a single Flutter application codebase, providing a consistent experience across web, desktop, and mobile platforms.

## 6. Implementation Lessons and Best Practices

### 6.1 Name Conflict Resolution

When working with this codebase, be aware of naming conflicts between Flutter and Structurizr:

- **Container**: Use `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Container;` to avoid conflicts with Structurizr's Container model class
- **Element**: Use `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Element;` for similar conflicts
- **View**: Use `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide View;` for view conflicts
- **Border**: Use `import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Border;` for border conflicts

For UI components that need to import all four, use:
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Container, Element, View, Border;
```

For class references, use these alias types:
- **ModelElement** instead of Element
- **ModelContainer** instead of Container
- **ModelView** instead of View

Replace Flutter's Container with Material or SizedBox for similar functionality:
```dart
// Instead of Container
Material(
  color: Colors.white,
  child: Padding(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
    child: Text('Hello'),
  ),
)

// Or SizedBox for simple dimensions
SizedBox(
  width: 200,
  height: 100,
  child: Text('Hello'),
)
```

UI-specific notes:
- When using a `GestureDetector`, the hover callback is `onPointerHover`, not `onHover`
- Some model relationships need to handle nullability properly
- Make layout improvements like:
  - Handle text overflow with `TextOverflow.ellipsis`
  - Use `Expanded` widgets for flexible sizing
  - Use `SingleChildScrollView` for potentially long content
- Add proper sizing constraints to prevent layout issues
- Prefer Material components over basic Container widgets

### 6.2 WebView and Widget Testing

- Use mock implementations for abstract classes and platform interfaces (e.g., WebViewPlatform) in tests.
- For WebView tests, inject a mock platform and use a test controller wrapper if needed for delegate/callback wiring.
- Use `findsWidgets` instead of `findsOneWidget` for components that may have multiple instances.
- Use ancestor finders for specific widget hierarchy checks.
- For context menu and right-click, verify structure rather than simulating clicks.
- For golden tests, plan for future visual regression coverage.
- Clean up unused imports and test helpers after refactors.

### 6.3 Error Handling

- Implement comprehensive error reporting with context-sensitive messages.
- Use structured error collectors for parser and model validation.
- Add robust error handling for file I/O and remote sync.

### 6.4 Performance

- Use chunking and caching for large document rendering (AsciiDoc, Markdown).
- Optimize rendering and layout for large diagrams (level-of-detail, culling, progressive loading).
- Plan for parallel processing and benchmarking in future phases.

### 6.5 UI/UX

- Provide keyboard shortcuts for all navigation-heavy interfaces.
- Use debouncing for export preview and performance-intensive UI updates.
- Implement help dialogs for keyboard shortcuts and advanced features.
- Use chip-based filtering and color coding for status and type indicators.

### 6.6 Workspace and Export

- Use platform-specific file system handling for workspace management.
- Implement auto-save and backup for reliability.
- Ensure all export formats are tested and previewed in the UI.

### 6.7 General

- Always keep specs and status in the `specs/` directory.
- Do not duplicate status or user documentation in this file.
- When in doubt, check the latest specs and implementation status for guidance.

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1 Unit Testing

Each individual component is tested in isolation with comprehensive test cases:

- **Domain Model Tests**: Verify model behavior, relationships, and validation

```dart
test('Element creation and properties', () {
  final person = Person(
    id: 'user',
    name: 'User',
```

## 2024-06 Update: Batch Fixes, Stabilization, and Modular Parser Refactor

- Major batch fixes have resolved ambiguous imports, type mismatches, and widget layout errors in tests.
- Parser, model, and widget tests are now stabilized and passing in most environments.
- Modular parser refactor is in progress; all parser/model/view files now use explicit imports and type aliases to avoid conflicts with Flutter built-ins.
- Widget layout errors in tests are resolved by removing top-level Expanded/Flexible or wrapping in SizedBox with explicit constraints.
- All contributors should use flutter test for running tests.
- See the Troubleshooting section in the README for common issues and solutions.

### Next Steps
- Continue modular parser refactor, following the audit and handoff tables.
- Complete integration of documentation and ADR components.
- Expand test coverage for new parser interfaces and UI components.
- Monitor for any remaining ambiguous import/type issues as refactor progresses.
