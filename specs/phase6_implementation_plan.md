## Best Practices and Lessons Learned

The implementation of ADR components has yielded several best practices and valuable lessons:

1. **Widget Testing Patterns**
   - Use `findsWidgets` instead of `findsOneWidget` when testing components that may have multiple instances of the same widget or text
   - Structure tests to verify both widget presence and functionality
   - Test complex interactions like filtering and searching with clear assertions

2. **Decision Visualization**
   - Implement a consistent color coding system for decision statuses across all components
   - Use chip-based filtering for intuitive user interaction
   - Provide clear visual feedback for filtering and selection actions
   - Use tooltips to provide additional context for relationships
   - Implement clustering for better organization of complex decision networks
   - Provide legends to help users understand visual encodings

3. **Interactive Graphics**
   - Implement robust error handling in force-directed layouts to prevent instability
   - Provide simulation controls for better user experience
   - Add intuitive zoom/pan controls with reasonable bounds
   - Use debouncing for performance-intensive interactions
   - Implement proper null safety checks for position data

4. **Test Implementation**
   - Create comprehensive test cases for all user interactions
   - Test filter combinations and edge cases
   - Use proper widget finders with appropriate matchers
   - Implement tests for complex components with multiple features
   - Test different rendering modes (dark/light) for styling consistency

5. **Component Architecture**
   - Separate rendering logic from business logic for better testability
   - Use composition over inheritance for flexible component design
   - Implement proper immutability for force-directed layout
   - Create reusable sub-components for common functionality
