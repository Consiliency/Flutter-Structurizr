**Legend:**  
âœ… Completeâ€ƒðŸš§ In Progress / Planned

**Test Plan:**  
- Each feature area will have dedicated unit, integration, and (where applicable) golden/performance tests.
- Undo/redo system is fully covered by unit tests.
- Other features will be covered as they are implemented, with test scripts and coverage reports updated accordingly.

# 2024-06 Update: Phase 9 Advanced Features
- Batch fixes have resolved most ambiguous imports and type mismatches in advanced feature files.
- All new code should use explicit imports and type aliasing to avoid conflicts with Flutter built-ins.
- See implementation_status.md for current completion status and next steps.
