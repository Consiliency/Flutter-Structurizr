   flutter test test/integration/dsl_parser_integration_test.dart
   ```

#### Writing Effective Lexer Tests

1. **Token Extraction Tests**:
   ```dart
   test('lexer correctly identifies tokens in DSL content', () {
     final lexer = Lexer('workspace "My Workspace" {');
     
     // Get next token
     Token token = lexer.nextToken();
     expect(token.type, TokenType.workspace);
     
     token = lexer.nextToken();
     expect(token.type, TokenType.string);
     expect(token.value, 'My Workspace');
     
     token = lexer.nextToken();
     expect(token.type, TokenType.leftBrace);
     
     token = lexer.nextToken();
     expect(token.type, TokenType.eof);
   });
   ```

2. **Testing Error Handling**:
   ```dart
   test('lexer reports errors for invalid tokens', () {
     final lexer = Lexer('workspace @invalid {');
     
     // First token should be valid
     Token token = lexer.nextToken();
     expect(token.type, TokenType.workspace);
     
     // Next token should cause an error
     token = lexer.nextToken();
     expect(token.type, TokenType.error);
     expect(token.value, contains('Unexpected character'));
   });
   ```

3. **Testing Complex Scenarios**:
   ```dart
   test('lexer handles complex nested structures', () {
     final input = '''
       workspace "Test" {
         model {
           person "User" {
             tags "External"
           }
         }
       }
     ''';
     
     final lexer = Lexer(input);
     List<Token> tokens = [];
     
     // Collect all tokens
     Token token;
     do {
       token = lexer.nextToken();
       tokens.add(token);
     } while (token.type != TokenType.eof);
     
     // Verify token count and specific tokens
     expect(tokens.length, 13); // Including EOF
     expect(tokens[0].type, TokenType.workspace);
     expect(tokens[1].type, TokenType.string);
     expect(tokens[1].value, 'Test');
     // etc.
   });
   ```

#### Testing the Parser

1. **AST Construction Tests**:
   ```dart
   test('parser correctly builds AST from tokens', () {
     final input = 'workspace "Test" { model { } }';
     final parser = Parser();
     
     // Parse input
     final ast = parser.parse(input);
     
     // Verify AST structure
     expect(ast, isA<WorkspaceNode>());
     expect((ast as WorkspaceNode).name, 'Test');
     expect(ast.children.length, 1);
     expect(ast.children[0], isA<ModelNode>());
   });
   ```

2. **Error Recovery Testing**:
   ```dart
   test('parser recovers from syntax errors', () {
     final input = 'workspace "Test" { model { person User } }'; // Missing quotes around User
     final parser = Parser();
     final errorReporter = TestErrorReporter();
     
     // Parse with error reporter
     final ast = parser.parse(input, errorReporter: errorReporter);
     
     // Verify errors were reported
     expect(errorReporter.errors, isNotEmpty);
     expect(errorReporter.errors[0].message, contains('Expected string literal'));
     
     // Verify recovery succeeded
     expect(ast, isA<WorkspaceNode>());
     expect(ast.children.length, 1);
   });
   ```

3. **Reference Resolution Testing**:
   ```dart
   test('parser resolves references between nodes', () {
     final input = '''
       workspace {
         model {
           person "User"
           softwareSystem "System"
           
           User -> System "Uses"
         }
       }
     ''';
     
     final parser = Parser();
     final ast = parser.parse(input);
     
     // Get relationship node
     final modelNode = (ast as WorkspaceNode).children[0] as ModelNode;
     final relationshipNode = modelNode.children.whereType<RelationshipNode>().first;
     
     // Verify reference resolution
     expect(relationshipNode.source, isNotNull);
     expect(relationshipNode.source!.name, 'User');
     expect(relationshipNode.destination, isNotNull);
     expect(relationshipNode.destination!.name, 'System');
   });
   ```

#### Error Reporting Testing

1. **Error Location Testing**:
   ```dart
   test('error reporter correctly identifies error locations', () {
     final input = '''
       workspace {
         model {
           person User
         }
       }
     ''';
     
     final errorReporter = ErrorReporter();
     final parser = Parser();
     parser.parse(input, errorReporter: errorReporter);
     
     // Verify error location
     expect(errorReporter.errors, isNotEmpty);
     final error = errorReporter.errors[0];
     expect(error.line, 3);
     expect(error.column, 18);  // Position after "person "
   });
   ```

2. **Error Message Testing**:
   ```dart
   test('error messages are clear and helpful', () {
     final input = 'workspace { model { -> } }';
     
     final errorReporter = ErrorReporter();
     final parser = Parser();
     parser.parse(input, errorReporter: errorReporter);
     
     // Verify error message
     expect(errorReporter.errors, isNotEmpty);
     final error = errorReporter.errors[0];
     expect(error.message, contains('Expected source element'));
     expect(error.message, contains('relationship definition'));
   });
   ```

#### Troubleshooting Parser Tests

## Ongoing Parser Refactor and Modularization

While the DSL parser and builder are functionally complete and all planned features have been implemented, the team is currently undertaking a major refactor of the parsing and model-building pipeline. This refactor modularizes the parser into interface-driven components (e.g., ModelParser, ViewsParser, RelationshipParser, etc.) to:
- Achieve full parity with the original Java Structurizr DSL implementation
- Enable parallel development and clearer handoff between teams
- Improve maintainability, extensibility, and testability

Developers should reference the audit and method handoff tables in `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` and `specs/refactored_method_relationship.md` for up-to-date interfaces, dependencies, and build order. This work does not affect end-user features but is critical for the long-term health of the codebase.

## Method Relationship Table Reference

See the main implementation spec for the method relationship tables and build order. All parser methods are implemented as per Tables 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
