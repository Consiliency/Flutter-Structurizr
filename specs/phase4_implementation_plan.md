# Phase 4: DSL Parser Implementation and Testing Plan

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on the Structurizr DSL (Domain Specific Language) parser implementation, which enables reading text-based architecture definitions and converting them into Structurizr workspace models. This phase covers lexical analysis, parsing, AST construction, model building, and error reporting.

## Current Status

- Added support for filtered views, custom views and image views
- Fixed routing conflicts in style definitions
- Designed comprehensive reference resolution system with support for:
  - Element references by ID and name (case-sensitive and case-insensitive)
  - "this" and "parent" special references in relationships
  - Deeply nested component references through multiple hierarchy levels
