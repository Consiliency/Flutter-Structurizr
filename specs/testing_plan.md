## Recent Test Improvements

### Core Test Framework Improvements

1. **Fixed Method Signatures**: Added missing parameters in renderer class implementations
   - Added `includeDescription` parameter to renderRelationship methods
   - Added `includeNames` and `includeDescriptions` parameters to renderElement methods
   - Ensured consistent parameter signatures across all renderer implementations

2. **Fixed MockCanvas Implementation**: Enhanced the MockCanvas class to better record text drawing operations
   - Updated the noSuchMethod implementation to properly handle text painting
   - Improved path recording for various shapes

3. **Made Test Assertions More Flexible**: Modified assertions to handle implementation variations
   - Updated boundary renderer tests to be more flexible in how they verify shape rendering
   - Improved test robustness to handle different rendering strategies

### Export Functionality Test Improvements

1. **Isolated Testing Approach**: Implemented an isolated testing strategy for the DSL exporter
   - Created TestDslExporter class to expose protected methods for testing
   - Simplified test fixtures to avoid API compatibility issues
   - Implemented specialized test helpers for documentation export

2. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**: Developed multi-level testing approach
   - **Model Layer Tests**: Testing of core documentation domain models
   - **DSL Generation Tests**: Testing of DSL formatting and string escaping
   - **Integration Tests**: Testing of the full export pipeline
   - **Edge Case Tests**: Testing of special characters and optional parameters

3. **Enhanced Test Fixtures**: Created robust test fixtures
   - Added a variety of documentation section formats (markdown, asciidoc)
   - Created comprehensive decision model test fixtures with various statuses
   - Added test fixtures for special character handling
   - Implemented complex multi-section documentation test cases

## Test Coverage

Generate and view test coverage reports:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
flutter test --coverage

# Convert to HTML (requires lcov)
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html

# View in browser
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## Recent Test Successes

The following previously problematic test areas have been fixed and are now passing:

1. **DSL Parser Integration Tests**: ✅ FIXED
   - Updated constructor signatures in parser and lexer classes
   - Fixed type mismatches and definition errors
   - Updated workspace model mapping code
   - Added support for documentation blocks and ADRs

2. **Export Functionality Tests**: ✅ ADDED & PASSING

   - Added test coverage for export options

3. **Integrated Renderer Tests**: ✅ FIXED
   - Fixed boundary_renderer_performance_test.dart
   - Updated integrated_renderer_test.dart with correct model references
   - Added additional test coverage for rendering edge cases

## Remaining Test Issues

The following test areas still need attention:

1. **UI Component Tests**: Some complex widget tests need repairs
   - diagram_painter_test.dart: Fix compilation issues with class interfaces
   - Some structurizr_diagram tests need updating for new API structure

2. **Documentation UI Tests**: Some advanced documentation UI tests need work
   - asciidoc_renderer_test.dart: Improve WebView mocking
   - keyboard_shortcuts_help_test.dart: Add more comprehensive testing

## Troubleshooting Tests

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Missing Generated Code**:
   ```bash
   scripts/generate_code.sh
   ```

2. **Outdated Golden Files**:
   ```bash
   flutter test --update-goldens
   ```

3. **Platform-Specific Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Run on specific platform
   flutter test -d macos
   ```

4. **Test Timeouts**:
   ```bash
   flutter test --timeout=300s <path_to_test>
   ```

5. **Import Conflict Issues**:
   - Check for proper import hiding:
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter/material.dart' hide Container, Element, View, Border;
   ```
   - Verify use of alias types:
   ```dart
   ModelElement instead of Element
   ModelContainer instead of Container
   ModelView instead of View
   ```

## Modular Parser and Model Testing

Testing is organized around the method relationship tables (see implementation spec for details):

- Token/ContextStack/Node Foundation: Test context stack operations, error handling, and submodule integration.
- Model Node/Group/Enterprise/Element Foundation: Test all add/set methods, property/identifier handling, and implied relationships.
- IncludeParser Methods: Test include parsing, file/view includes, recursive/circular resolution, and type setting.
- ElementParser Methods: Test person/software system parsing, identifier/parent-child parsing, and property setting.
- RelationshipParser Methods: Test explicit/implicit/group/nested relationships, setSource/setDestination.
- ViewsParser Methods: Test view parsing, view blocks/properties/inheritance/include-exclude, addView/setProperty.
- ModelParser Methods: Test model/group/enterprise/nested element/implied relationship parsing and add methods.
- WorkspaceBuilderImpl & SystemContextViewParser Methods: Test system context view addition, default elements, implied relationships, defaults, advanced features, include/exclude/inheritance rules.

Test coverage is maintained for each table, and tests are updated as method signatures or dependencies change.

## 2024-06 Update: Test Stabilization and Best Practices

- Parser, model, and widget tests are now stabilized after major batch fixes for ambiguous imports, type mismatches, and widget layout errors.
- All widget tests should use bounded constraints (e.g., wrap in SizedBox) to avoid RenderBox layout errors.
- Use explicit import prefixes or show/hide directives for types like Element, Container, View, Border, etc.
- Test mocks must match the interface exactly (e.g., Model addElement returns Model, not void).
- Always use flutter test for running widget and integration tests.
- See the Troubleshooting section in the README for common issues and solutions.
