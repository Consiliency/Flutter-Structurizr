# Phase 8: Export Capabilities Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 8 focused on implementing export capabilities for Flutter Structurizr, allowing users to export diagrams and workspace models to various formats. This phase covered raster and vector image export, text-based diagram formats, and workspace serialization.

## Current Status

**Status: COMPLETE (100%)** ✅

All core export features are fully implemented and tested:

✅ Completed:
- Framework for diagram exporter interface
- PNG and SVG exporters with full rendering and configuration options
- Comprehensive text-based format exporters (Mermaid, PlantUML, DOT)
- C4 model exporter (JSON/YAML) for all diagram types
- DSL exporter with documentation and ADR support (markdown, AsciiDoc)
- Batch export capability for multiple diagrams
- Export dialogs (single and batch) with format selection, options, and progress
- Export preview widgets for all formats (real-time, debounced, metadata extraction)
- Transparent background support for PNG exports
- Memory-efficient export pipeline for large diagrams
- Progress reporting and error handling in UI and backend
- Special character handling and proper formatting in all exporters
- Comprehensive test suite for all exporters and documentation export
- Dedicated tests for documentation/ADR export, SVG preview, and export dialogs
- Integration with Export Manager for seamless usage

## Future Improvements & Known Limitations

The following technical challenges and improvements are planned for future phases, but do not affect the core export functionality:
- Unified rendering pipeline abstraction for all formats
- Golden image comparison and comprehensive visual regression testing
- Performance benchmarking for large diagrams and export operations
- Some UI tests are limited by Flutter test environment constraints (e.g., image package, file system)
- Naming conflicts and import organization improvements

## Implementation Completion

Phase 8 is fully complete for all user-facing export features. All major formats, batch export, dialogs, preview, and documentation/ADR export are implemented and verified. Remaining technical challenges are tracked for future improvement but do not impact current export capabilities.
