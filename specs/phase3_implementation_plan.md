## Testing Strategy

The testing approach for Phase 3 included:

1. ✅ **Widget Tests**
   - Testing widgets in isolation with simulated interactions
   - Verifying widget rendering and behavior
   - Testing callback triggering
   - Testing state management

2. ✅ **Integration Tests**
   - Testing component interactions (diagram with controls, etc.)
   - Verifying proper state propagation between components
   - Testing complex interaction scenarios

3. ✅ **Visual Tests**
   - Using golden image testing for visual verification
   - Testing different themes and configurations

4. ✅ **Standalone Component Tests**
   - Created individual test files for each component:
     - ElementExplorer: 4 tests ✅
     - DiagramControls: 7 tests ✅
     - AnimationControls: 5 tests ✅
     - Original component tests continue to pass ✅
