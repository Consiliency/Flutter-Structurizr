# Phase 1: Core Model Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on the fundamental domain model implementation for Flutter Structurizr, providing the foundation for the entire application. This phase covers the core model elements, views, styling, and JSON serialization.

## Current Status

**Status: COMPLETE** ✅

All core domain model implementation is complete and thoroughly tested, including:
- Element class hierarchy
- Workspace and Model classes
- View definitions
- Styling system
- JSON serialization/deserialization

## Completed Tasks

### Core Model Implementation

1. ✅ **Element Class Hierarchy**
   - Implemented `Element` abstract base class in `lib/domain/model/element.dart`
   - Created concrete implementations for all element types:
     - `Person`
     - `SoftwareSystem`
     - `Container`
     - `Component`
     - `DeploymentNode`
     - `ContainerInstance`
   - Added relationship handling and support for properties, tags, and descriptions
   - Implemented proper equality comparison and hashCode generation
   - Added comprehensive unit tests in `test/domain/model/element_test.dart`

2. ✅ **Workspace and Model Classes**
   - Implemented `Workspace` class in `lib/domain/model/workspace.dart`
   - Created `Model` class in `lib/domain/model/model.dart` with element management
   - Added methods for adding, retrieving, and removing elements
   - Implemented validation rules for uniqueness and model integrity
   - Created comprehensive unit tests in `test/domain/model/workspace_test.dart` and `test/domain/model/model_test.dart`

3. ✅ **View Implementation**
   - Implemented all view types in `lib/domain/view/view.dart`:
     - `SystemLandscapeView`
     - `SystemContextView`
     - `ContainerView`
     - `ComponentView`
     - `DynamicView`
     - `DeploymentView`
     - `FilteredView`
   - Added methods for element inclusion/exclusion and filtering
   - Added animation step support for dynamic views
   - Created comprehensive unit tests in `test/domain/view/view_test.dart`

4. ✅ **Styling System**
   - Implemented style classes in `lib/domain/style/styles.dart`:
     - `ElementStyle` for element appearance
     - `RelationshipStyle` for connection appearance
     - `Themes` for grouping styles
     - `Branding` for custom visuals
   - Added support for shapes, colors, fonts, and other visual properties
   - Implemented style inheritance and inheritance rules
   - Created comprehensive unit tests in `test/domain/style/styles_test.dart`

### JSON Serialization

1. ✅ **JSON Schema Definition**
   - Defined JSON schema for all model classes using `freezed_annotation`
   - Generated serialization code with `build_runner`
   - Ensured compatibility with the Structurizr JSON schema

2. ✅ **Serialization Adapters**
   - Implemented serialization adapters in `lib/infrastructure/serialization/json_serialization.dart`
   - Added custom type adapters for special cases
   - Created comprehensive unit tests in `test/infrastructure/serialization/json_serialization_test.dart`

3. ✅ **Error Handling**
   - Implemented robust error handling for JSON parsing
   - Added validation during deserialization
   - Created tests for error scenarios with malformed JSON

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for Phase 1 included:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Testing all model classes for proper property access, equality comparison, and relationship management
   - Testing serialization/deserialization with both valid and invalid inputs
   - Testing view operations like element addition/removal and filtering

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Testing the entire model-to-JSON-to-model roundtrip
   - Testing complex workspace scenarios with multiple elements and relationships

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all model classes
   - Edge case testing for serialization
   - Validation rules testing

## Verification

All tests for the core model implementation are passing. The model implementation provides a solid foundation for the rest of the application and accurately represents the Structurizr domain model.

The core model can be used to create, load, modify, and save Structurizr workspaces with all supported element types, views, and styles.

## Next Steps

As Phase 1 is complete, the project can proceed to:

1. ✅ Build the rendering engine on top of the domain model (Phase 2)
2. ✅ Create UI components for interacting with the model (Phase 3)
3. ✅ Implement DSL parsing to convert text-based definitions to model instances (Phase 4)
