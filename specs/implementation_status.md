# Implementation Status

> **Note:** While all core phases (1-8) are functionally complete, a major parser refactor is currently in progress. The DSL parser and builder are being modularized into interface-driven components for maintainability, Java parity, and parallel development. See `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` and `specs/refactored_method_relationship.md` for details. This does not affect end-user features but is critical for long-term code health.

## Modular Parser and Method Relationships

The parser and model-building pipeline is now fully modularized. The following method relationship tables define the build order and dependencies for all parser/model components (see also the main implementation spec):

- Token/ContextStack/Node Foundation
- Model Node/Group/Enterprise/Element Foundation
- IncludeParser Methods
- ElementParser Methods
- RelationshipParser Methods
- ViewsParser Methods
- ModelParser Methods
- WorkspaceBuilderImpl & SystemContextViewParser Methods

Each table groups methods that are tightly coupled and should be implemented/tested together. This structure is now reflected in the codebase and test suite.

## 2024-06 Update: Batch Fixes and Stabilization

- Major batch fixes completed for ambiguous imports, type mismatches, and widget layout errors in tests.
- Parser, model, and widget tests are now stabilized and passing in most environments.
- Modular parser refactor is in progress; all parser/model/view files now use explicit imports and type aliases to avoid conflicts with Flutter built-ins.
- Widget layout errors in tests are resolved by removing top-level Expanded/Flexible or wrapping in SizedBox with explicit constraints.
- All contributors should use `flutter test` for running tests.

### Next Steps
- Continue modular parser refactor, following the audit and handoff tables.
- Complete integration of documentation and ADR components.
- Expand test coverage for new parser interfaces and UI components.
- Monitor for any remaining ambiguous import/type issues as refactor progresses.
