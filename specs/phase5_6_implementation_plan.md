## Implementation Approach

### 1. Markdown and AsciiDoc Rendering

For completing the documentation rendering functionality:

1. **Markdown Enhancement**
   - Evaluate and potentially update the `flutter_markdown` dependency
   - Implement custom Markdown syntax extensions for diagram embedding
   - Add support for additional Markdown features like tables and footnotes

2. **AsciiDoc Implementation**
   - Research suitable Dart/Flutter libraries for AsciiDoc parsing
   - If no suitable library exists, implement a basic AsciiDoc parser
   - Convert AsciiDoc elements to appropriate Flutter widgets
   - Ensure consistent styling between Markdown and AsciiDoc

### 2. Diagram Embedding

For completing the diagram embedding functionality:

1. **Syntax Extension**
   - Define a custom syntax for diagram references: `![Title](embed:diagram-key)`
   - Implement a custom syntax handler in the Markdown and AsciiDoc renderers
   - Add diagram reference resolution from workspace model

2. **Embedded Renderer**
   - Create a scaled-down version of the diagram renderer for embedding
   - Implement proper sizing and resolution
   - Add interactive elements (click to open full diagram)

### 3. Documentation Navigation

For enhancing the documentation navigation:

1. **Improved Navigation**
   - Add breadcrumb navigation
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add support for deep linking
   - Create a persistent navigation state

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Enhance the documentation UI for different screen sizes
   - Implement collapsible navigation for small screens
   - Add print-friendly view for documentation

### 4. ADR Enhancements

For improving Architecture Decision Record support:

1. **Decision Graph**
   - Research appropriate graph visualization libraries
   - Implement a force-directed layout for decision relationships
   - Add interactive elements for exploration

2. **Timeline View**
   - Create a custom timeline visualization
   - Implement date filtering and grouping
   - Add visual indicators for decision status

## Testing Strategy

   - Verify responsive layout for different screen sizes

2. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Test screen reader compatibility
   - Verify keyboard navigation
   - Test color contrast for readability

## Verification

To verify the completion of Phases 5-6, we will:

1. **Functionality Verification**
   - Ensure all documentation features work as expected
   - Verify ADR features are complete and integrated
   - Test with complex real-world documentation

2. **Integration Verification**
   - Verify seamless integration with the main application
   - Test navigation between diagrams and documentation
   - Verify consistent state management

3. **Performance Verification**
