# C4-PlantUML Summary

## Overview
C4-PlantUML is an open-source library that integrates the C4 model for software architecture with PlantUML's diagramming capabilities. It enables developers to create standardized software architecture diagrams using text-based notation.

## Key Features

### Diagram Types Supported
- System Context diagrams
- Container diagrams
- Component diagrams
- Dynamic diagrams
- Deployment diagrams
- Sequence diagrams

### Core Components
- Specialized macros for C4 model elements (Person, System, Container, Component)
- Relationship definitions with directional associations
- Boundary definitions for system grouping
- Layout and styling customization options
- Support for icons/sprites to enhance visual representation

### Implementation Details
- Based on PlantUML syntax with custom extensions
- Library files are modular (C4_Context.puml, C4_Container.puml, etc.)
- Multiple inclusion methods:
  - Direct GitHub URL inclusion
  - Local file inclusion
  - "Local" library for limited connectivity environments

## Basic Usage Example

```plantuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Container.puml

Person(user, "Customer")
System_Boundary(system, "Sample System") {
    Container(webapp, "Web Application", "Technology")
}
Rel(user, webapp, "Uses")
```

## Benefits
- Text-based approach enables version control integration
- Platform-independent visualization
- Standardized representation following C4 model principles
- Quick diagram creation with intuitive syntax
- Supports detailed, multi-level system representations

## Integration Considerations
- Can be used with various PlantUML renderers and tools
- Works well with documentation systems and CI/CD pipelines
- Suitable for both high-level and detailed architecture documentation
- Compatible with other PlantUML extensions for additional customization
