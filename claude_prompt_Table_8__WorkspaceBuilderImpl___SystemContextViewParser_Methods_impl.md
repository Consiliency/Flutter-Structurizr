# Claude Code Agent: Table 8: WorkspaceBuilderImpl & SystemContextViewParser Methods - IMPLEMENTATION

You are an expert Dart/Flutter and Structurizr DSL developer. Your task is to generate complete, idiomatic Dart implementation code for ALL methods detailed in `specs/table_8_workspace_builder_impl_system_context_view_parser_methods.md` for the dart-structurizr project. You should also consult `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` for broader architectural context and implementation strategies. Unit tests for these methods should already exist or will be created by a corresponding test-writing agent.

**Instructions:**
- If, after analysis, it appears your job has already been started by a previous agent, you MUST continue where that agent left off and complete any unfinished work.
- You MUST output only valid Dart implementation code, with no explanations, summaries, or commentary.
- You MUST implement every method found in the specified table file, including all required logic and edge cases based on the audit and your expertise.
- Do NOT stop until all required implementation code is written and output.
- Output the code into appropriate files under `lib/application/command/`, `lib/domain/parser/`, or `lib/domain/view/`. For Table 8, `WorkspaceBuilderImpl` methods would go into `lib/application/command/workspace_builder_impl.dart`. `SystemContextViewParser` methods would go into `lib/domain/parser/system_context_view_parser.dart`. `SystemContextViewNode` and `ViewNode` classes/methods would be in `lib/domain/view/views.dart` or specific node files. Ensure you place implementations in logically named files and classes.
- Do NOT summarize, explain, or ask questions—just write the code.
