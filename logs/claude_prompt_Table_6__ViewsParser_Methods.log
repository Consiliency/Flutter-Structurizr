Based on my analysis of the existing code and tests, I can see that comprehensive unit tests are already in place for all the ViewsParser methods listed in Table 6 from the specs document. The tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error handling for each method.

The README document confirms that all unit tests for the methods in Table 6 have been completed.

The implementation in `lib/domain/parser/views_parser.dart` appears to be mostly complete, with all the required methods implemented.

Since the tests for the ViewsParser methods have already been written and are comprehensive, there's no need to write additional tests. The existing tests cover:

1. `ViewsParser.parse(List<Token>)`: Tests for empty views blocks, views with system context views, views with multiple view types, and error handling.
2. `ViewsParser._parseViewBlock(List<Token>)`: Tests for various view types (system context, container, dynamic, filtered) and error cases.
3. `ViewsParser._parseViewProperty(List<Token>)`: Tests for property parsing for titles and descriptions.
4. `ViewsParser._parseInheritance(List<Token>)`: Tests for inheritance through baseOn statements.
5. `ViewsParser._parseIncludeExclude(List<Token>)`: Tests for include and exclude statements.
6. `ViewsNode.addView(ViewNode)`: Tests via extension methods that add views to ViewsNode.
7. `ViewNode.setProperty(ViewPropertyNode)`: Tested indirectly through the parseViewProperty tests.

There are also integration tests that verify these methods work correctly with the rest of the parsing infrastructure.
