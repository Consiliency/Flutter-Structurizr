Great! The comprehensive tests for all required methods from Table 1 have been successfully implemented. Let's review what we've accomplished:

1. `context_stack_test.dart`: Complete tests for ContextStack methods:
   - push, pop, current, clear, size
   - Additional tests for error handling, edge cases, and convenience methods

2. `parse_error_handler_test.dart`: Complete tests for the handleError method:
   - Error reporting with context information
   - Position tracking and token handling
   - Error categorization
   - Error recovery and synchronization
   - Integration tests for real parsing scenarios

3. `submodule_integration_test.dart`: Complete tests for the integrateSubmodules method:
   - Basic integration of submodules
   - Nested includes and circular references
   - Element, relationship, view, style and documentation merging
   - Error handling and conflict resolution
   - Complex hierarchies and real file system testing
   - Verification of subparser invocation

All required methods from Table 1 have been thoroughly tested with both basic functionality tests and more complex scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions.
