We've successfully created a comprehensive set of unit tests for the ElementParser and its methods. Here's a summary of the test files we've created:

1. `element_parser_test_extended.dart` - Comprehensive tests for all basic methods
2. `element_parser_error_handling_test.dart` - Tests focused on error handling and recovery
3. `element_parser_context_test.dart` - Tests focused on context stack handling
4. `element_identifier_extended_test.dart` - Tests focused on identifier parsing and generation
5. `element_parser_integration_complex_test.dart` - Tests for complex scenarios and integration with other parsers

These tests cover all the requirements from the specs/table_4_element_parser_methods.md file, including:

1. Basic functionality of all methods
2. Error handling and edge cases
3. Context stack integrity
4. Identifier parsing and generation
5. Parent-child relationship handling
6. Integration with ModelParser and RelationshipParser
7. Special character handling in names, identifiers, and properties
8. Performance considerations with large inputs
9. Internationalization support

The tests are designed to be thorough, maintainable, and provide good coverage of the ElementParser implementation. They also match the Java implementation's expectations and behaviors as outlined in the specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md file.
