All the implementation is complete:

1. In SystemContextViewParser:
   - Enhanced the parse method
   - Implemented handleIncludeAll, handleIncludeExclude, populateDefaults, and setAdvancedFeatures methods

2. Added ViewNodeExtensions and SystemContextViewNodeExtensions with:
   - Implemented addElement, setProperty, hasProperty, hasElement methods for ViewNode
   - Implemented setIncludeRule, setExcludeRule, setInheritance methods for SystemContextViewNode

3. Updated ReferenceResolver to support getModel and setModel

The WorkspaceBuilderImpl already had the required methods:
   - addSystemContextView, addDefaultElements, addImpliedRelationships, populateDefaults, setDefaultsFromJava

All required methods from Table 8 have been implemented, and the code is coherent and follows the patterns and styles of the existing code.
