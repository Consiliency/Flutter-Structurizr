I've created comprehensive unit tests for all the methods detailed in Table 2 (Model Node/Group/Enterprise/Element Foundation). The tests cover the standard use cases as well as edge cases, error conditions, and additional scenarios for each method. I've organized these tests into separate files to maintain clarity and focus:

1. `/test/domain/parser/model_node_comprehensive_test.dart` - Tests for ModelNode methods
2. `/test/domain/parser/group_node_comprehensive_test.dart` - Tests for GroupNode methods
3. `/test/domain/parser/enterprise_node_comprehensive_test.dart` - Tests for EnterpriseNode methods
4. `/test/domain/parser/element_node_comprehensive_test.dart` - Tests for ElementNode methods
5. `/test/domain/model/model_node_group_enterprise_comprehensive_test.dart` - Tests for Model domain classes
6. `/test/domain/model/element_operations_comprehensive_test.dart` - Tests for Element operations

Each test file follows the existing testing patterns in the codebase while providing enhanced test coverage. The tests include:

- Basic functionality tests
- Edge cases (null values, empty strings, etc.)
- Error handling tests
- Property preservation tests
- Multiple operations in sequence
- Tests for all supported data types (strings, numbers, booleans, complex objects)

These tests will ensure that the methods are robust, handle all expected input types, and maintain object immutability where appropriate.
