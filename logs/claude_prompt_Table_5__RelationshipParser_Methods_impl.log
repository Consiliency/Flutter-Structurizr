I have successfully implemented the RelationshipParser methods as specified in table_5_relationship_parser_methods.md. 

Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Added proper integration with the ContextStack class to push and pop appropriate contexts during parsing:
   - In the `parse` method, I push a 'relationship' context
   - In the `_parseExplicit` method, I push an 'explicitRelationship' context
   - In the `_parseImplicit` method, I push an 'implicitRelationship' context
   - In the `_parseGroup` method, I push a 'group' context
   - In the `_parseNested` method, I push a 'nestedElement' context

2. Enhanced the constructor to require the error reporter and optionally take a ContextStack and ElementParser.

3. Updated the error handling to use the errorReporter consistently.

4. Enhanced the `_parseGroup` and `_parseNested` methods to properly handle block content and recursively parse their inner relationships.

5. Added proper integration with ElementParser._parseIdentifier for parsing source and destination identifiers when available.

6. Updated the RelationshipNodeExtensions for setSource and setDestination to maintain the required interface.

7. Improved error recovery by ensuring contexts are popped properly even when exceptions occur.

8. Added proper handling of nested relationship contexts for correct parent-child relationship building.

The implementation follows the structure and requirements from the specification while maintaining the existing functionality of the RelationshipParser class.
