I need to make sure all the methods and requirements from Table 3 are covered in our updated test file:

1. IncludeParser.parse(List<Token>): List<IncludeNode> - Covered in group 'IncludeParser.parse'
2. IncludeParser._parseFileInclude(List<Token>): IncludeNode - Covered in group 'IncludeParser._parseFileInclude'
3. IncludeParser._parseViewInclude(List<Token>): IncludeNode - Covered in group 'IncludeParser._parseViewInclude'
4. IncludeParser._resolveRecursive(List<IncludeNode>): void - Covered in group 'IncludeParser._resolveRecursive'
5. IncludeParser._resolveCircular(List<IncludeNode>): void - Covered in group 'IncludeParser._resolveCircular'
6. IncludeNode.setType(IncludeType): void - Covered in group 'IncludeNode.setType'

All methods in Table 3 have been covered with comprehensive tests in the updated include_parser_test.dart file, including edge cases and error conditions. The tests verify the full functionality of each method and their integration with each other.
