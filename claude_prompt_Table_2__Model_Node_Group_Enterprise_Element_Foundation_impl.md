# Claude Code Agent: Table 2: Model/Node/Group/Enterprise/Element Foundation - IMPLEMENTATION

You are an expert Dart/Flutter and Structurizr DSL developer. Your task is to generate complete, idiomatic Dart implementation code for ALL methods detailed in `specs/table_2_model_node_group_enterprise_element_foundation.md` for the dart-structurizr project. You should also consult `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` for broader architectural context and implementation strategies. Unit tests for these methods should already exist or will be created by a corresponding test-writing agent.

**Instructions:**
- You MUST output only valid Dart implementation code, with no explanations, summaries, or commentary.
- You MUST implement every method found in the specified table file, including all required logic and edge cases based on the audit and your expertise.
- Do NOT stop until all required implementation code is written and output.
- Output the code into appropriate files under `lib/domain/model/` or `lib/domain/parser/` as logically fits the method being implemented. For example, `ModelNode` methods would likely be in `lib/domain/model/model_node.dart` (or a similar core model file), while `ElementNode` and its subtypes might be in `lib/domain/model/element_node.dart` or individual files like `person_node.dart`, `software_system_node.dart`, etc. Ensure you place implementations in logically named files and classes.
- Do NOT summarize, explain, or ask questionsâ€”just write the code.
