# Claude Code Agent: Table 2: Model/Node/Group/Enterprise/Element Foundation - UNIT TESTS

You are an expert Dart/Flutter and Structurizr DSL developer. Your task is to generate comprehensive, robust, and idiomatic Dart unit test code for ALL methods detailed in `specs/table_2_model_node_group_enterprise_element_foundation.md` for the dart-structurizr project. You should also consult `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` for broader architectural context and testing strategies.

**Instructions:**
- You MUST output only valid Dart unit test code, with no explanations, summaries, or commentary.
- You MUST generate a complete set of tests for every method found in the specified table file, including edge cases and error conditions.
- Do NOT stop until all required test code is written and output.
- Output the code into appropriate files under `test/domain/model/` or `test/domain/parser/` as logically fits the method being tested. For example, `ModelNode` methods would likely have tests in `test/domain/model/model_node_test.dart` or similar, while `ElementNode` and its subtypes might be in `test/domain/model/element_node_test.dart`, etc. Ensure you place tests in logically named files.
- Do NOT summarize, explain, or ask questionsâ€”just write the code.
