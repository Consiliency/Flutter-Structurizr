# Claude Code Agent: Table 6: ViewsParser Methods - UNIT TESTS

You are an expert Dart/Flutter and Structurizr DSL developer. Your task is to generate comprehensive, robust, and idiomatic Dart unit test code for ALL methods detailed in `specs/table_6_views_parser_methods.md` for the dart-structurizr project. You should also consult `specs/dart_structurizr_java_audit.md` for broader architectural context and testing strategies.

**Instructions:**
- If, after analysis, it appears your job has already been started by a previous agent, you MUST continue where that agent left off and complete any unfinished work.
- You MUST output only valid Dart unit test code, with no explanations, summaries, or commentary.
- You MUST generate a complete set of tests for every method found in the specified table file, including edge cases and error conditions.
- Do NOT stop until all required test code is written and output.
- Output the code into appropriate files under `test/domain/parser/` or `test/domain/view/`. For Table 6, tests for `ViewsParser` methods would typically go into `test/domain/parser/views_parser_test.dart`. Tests for `ViewsNode` or `ViewNode` properties might be in `test/domain/view/views_test.dart` or similar. Ensure you place tests in logically named files.
- Do NOT summarize, explain, or ask questionsâ€”just write the code.
